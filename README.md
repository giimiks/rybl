# Rybl (ryblang)

## Overview

Ryblang is a hobby C style programming language. Its purpose is solely my recreation and skill development. As of now, rybl isn't aimed at being a production-ready language, as it's only a solo project of a first year software engineering student and not a full on Rust rewrite of Rust, which was rewritten in Rust.
