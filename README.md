# Rybl (ryblang)

## Overview

Ryblang is a hobby C style programming language. Its purpose is solely my recreation and skill development. As of now, rybl isn't aimed at being a production-ready language, as it's only a solo project of a first year software engineering student and not a full on Rust rewrite of Rust, which was rewritten in Rust. I am aiming to learn about parsing, learn about abstract syntax trees and trees as a whole, learn some Golang while I'm at it and also learn about different tooling, pipelines, build systems and so on.
